# Gemini CLI Chatbot Project

This project consists of a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend that integrates with the OpenAI API to provide a chatbot experience. Both the backend and frontend have been migrated to TypeScript, and the project now includes a `shell.nix` for managing the development environment.

## TypeScript Migration

Both the `server` and `web` directories have been successfully migrated to TypeScript. All `.js` files were converted to `.ts` or `.tsx`, type definitions were added, and `tsconfig.json` files were configured. The `package.json` scripts were updated to support TypeScript compilation and execution.

## Next Steps

-   Implement additional features for the chatbot.
